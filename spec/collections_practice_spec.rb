      The summer of tenth grade was the best summer of my life.  
      I went to the beach everyday and we had amazing weather.  
      The weather didnt really vary much and was always pretty hot although sometimes at night it would rain.  
      I didnt mind the rain because it would cool everything down and allow us to sleep peacefully.  
      Its amazing how much the weather affects your mood.  
      Who would have thought that I could write a whole essay just about the weather in tenth grade.  
      Its kind of amazing right?  Youd think for such an interesting person I might have more to say but you would be wrong.
